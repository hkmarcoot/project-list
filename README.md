## Scrimba Solo Projects - Frontend Developer Career Path

Jul 2024 - Present

The Solo Projects are included in the Frontend Developer Career Path in Scrimba, their flagship course teaching programmer to be a junior frontend developer.

The project applies what I learned in the CSS courses. Scrimba provided me a Figma design, and the goal is to create a web page with HTML and CSS that is as close to the same design as possible.

Skills: HTML5 · Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

## EasyA x Polkadot London Hackathon 2025 - Astartes.Dot

Apr 2025 - Apr 2025

What is Astartes.Dot?
Astartes is a tamper-evident logging and forensic audit system designed to enhance integrity in high-security infrastructure. It ensures that logs cannot be silently altered by internal actors—even with privileged access—by anchoring cryptographic proofs to a public blockchain and verifying log consistency across distributed systems.

Built with modularity in mind, Astartes uses lightweight agents to compute Merkle roots on each server, a centralized verifier to perform cross-checks and a blockchain publisher to anchor immutable proofs. This layered approach provides robust, post-event forensic traceability without introducing major overhead.

Astartes can operate independently or complement other systems like centralized detection-as-code frameworks. It’s designed for scale and becomes more cost-efficient as infrastructure grows—ideal for government departments and medium to large orgs.

## Friend Of Two - AI Powered Mutual Friend - Zero to One Hackathon by Convex Vol 2 in 2024

Sep 2024 - Sep 2024

Inspiration
Have you ever tried to get to know a new person but need more confirming information? Those who say they have known that person for a long time may not even have a deep understanding of him/her! With the power of AI, we can now create an AI-powered mutual friend to help solve this problem and make making a new friend easier. The AI is tailor-made by you so that what you like / dislike can be understood by anyone who wants to get close to you.

What it does
Users will create a chatroom with their tailor-made AI mutual friends by filling in their hobbies, interests, hates, and anything they want others to know. Other app users can enter the chatroom and ask questions about the AI owner. The AI mutual friend will reply to any question with the information given by the owner.

Skills: Convex · Convex Auth · React Native · TypeScript · iOS · Android · OpenAI

## COVID-19 Hong Kong Information Center - MIT App Inventor Hackathon 2020

Jul 2020 - Aug 2020

Associated with Techbob Academy Hong Kong

It is an Android App created using the MIT App Inventor. With this app, I won 3rd place in the adult track in the MIT App Inventor Hackathon 2020. The app provides live information about COVID-19 to app users in Hong Kong.

One of the app's key features is its ability to provide live walking alerts, warning users if they are within 20 meters of infected locations. These locations are marked with a red dot, and you can access more information by pressing on the marker. Only markers in close proximity to you will be shown.

The second feature of the app is to show all the locations in Hong Kong that were infected within 14 days on the map. You can have an overview of the situation in Hong Kong. Again, you can know more by clicking on the markers.

The third feature directs users to the Hong Kong government's COVID-19 news webpage. You can read the latest news here.

The final feature is to read the database in a list view. You can check the case number and the infected locations in a list.
